      "I think you should correct the following sentence - p.R337 loci of 11HSDB2 to- “The p.R337 residue of 11-β-dehydrogenase isozyme 2 enzyme is a recognised mutation site. The mutation p.R337C has been previously identified in a family from Iran with three affected children.”",

    "originalityComment":
      "Please specify as the mechanism of loss of function of the mutation in patients with mutations at position p.335-339 is reduced protein stability due to rapid protein degradation at the proteasome, rather than reduced catalysis."
