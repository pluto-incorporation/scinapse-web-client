    "Paper- or foil-like materials are used in many technological applications, as protective layers, chemical filters and adhesives, for instance. So-called 'bucky' paper, based on carbon nanotubes, has the potential to extend the use of high-tech papers to applications such as fuel cells, as it has good mechanical and electrical properties. Now a new carbon nanocomposite paper-like material has been prepared that promises superior performance in stiffness, strength and flexibility: graphene oxide paper. It is based on nanoscale graphene oxide sheets that are interlocked and tiled together in a near-parallel fashion.",
